# Linux DXVK Cache

It's a repository mainly containing my DXVK state cache files.  
Feel free to use them at your heart content.  

Also providing a little script to install them.  
The script is automatically backing up your current state cache files in cases mine are breaking your experience.

As for now, the script is not finished.

Steam default DXVK state cache folder:
`${HOME}/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/shadercache/*/DXVK_state_cache`
